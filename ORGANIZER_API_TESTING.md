## ‚úÖ **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Organizer registration works
- [ ] Email verification works
- [ ] Login returns valid token
- [ ] Create event works (check approval status)
- [ ] Get my events returns only organizer's events
- [ ] Update event works with ownership validation
- [ ] Delete event prevents deletion with bookings
- [ ] Create tickets for events
- [ ] Update/delete tickets work
- [ ] Booking endpoints return correct data
- [ ] Role-based access control works (try with regular user token)

## üö® **Expected Behaviors**

1. **New events** should have `approved: false` initially
2. **Only organizers** can access organizer endpoints
3. **Ownership validation** prevents editing other's events/tickets
4. **Events with bookings** cannot be deleted
5. **Pagination** works for large datasets

## üîç **Common Issues**

- **401 Unauthorized**: Check token in Authorization header
- **403 Forbidden**: User role is not "organizer"
- **404 Not Found**: Event/ticket doesn't exist or wrong ownership
- **400 Bad Request**: Missing required fields or invalid data format
